# Advent of Code 2018

## Philosophy

I am trying to solve the AoC puzzles using
techniques and principles I am interest at
the moment.

### TCR

I use a `test && commit || revert` workflow
encouraging tiny steps.

### 50 character line limit

I am trying to explore what difference line
length limits make. And to make a point of it I
am confining myself to 50 characters per line.

## Day 1

### Part one

This puzzle was solved with a straight forward
recursive function with a base case.

### Part two

I ended up solving this using two agents keeping
track of which "change-in-frequency" is next,
and what frequencies we've hit already.
